# Answers

### 1.1. **What is Jira, and how is it used in software development?**
Jira is a project management tool developed by Atlassian, widely used for issue tracking and managing software development projects. It's particularly effective for Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban. In my experience, Jira has helped teams collaborate efficiently, prioritize tasks, and track project progress from conception to completion.

### 1.2. **Explain the key components of Jira, such as issues, projects, workflows, and boards.**
Jira revolves around *issues* (tasks, bugs, etc.), *projects* (containers for issues), *workflows* (steps/issues follow from creation to completion), and *boards* (visual tools for tracking progress, e.g., Scrum or Kanban).

---

### 2.1. **What is a workflow in Jira, and how do you customize it?**
A workflow in Jira defines the steps or statuses an issue goes through, from start to resolution. For instance, statuses like '**To Do**', '**In Progress**', and '**Done**' can form a typical workflow. Customizing workflows involves **adding** or **modifying statuses**, **transitions**, and **post-functions** using the Workflow Editor, ensuring it aligns with the team's process.

### 2.2. **How do you create, assign, and track issues in Jira?**
Issues can be created via the navigation bar, backlog, or board. Assign them to team members and track progress using statuses, comments, and linked subtasks.

---

### 3.1. **What types of reports can Jira generate, and how do they help in project management?**
Jira generates various reports, like **burndown charts**, **sprint reports**, **velocity charts**, and **cumulative flow diagrams**. These reports provide insights into team **performance**, **progress**, and **bottlenecks**, which helps in making informed decisions and improving efficiency.

### 3.2. **How do you customize a Jira dashboard to track project progress?**
Dashboards are tailored by adding gadgets (e.g., Sprint Health, Issue Statistics) and configuring layouts to monitor progress and share updates.

---

### 4.1. **How does Jira integrate with other tools like Git, Jenkins, or Slack?**
"Jira integrates seamlessly with tools like Git and Jenkins for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). For instance, issues can be linked with commits and branches in Git. Integration with Slack allows notifications and updates to be shared with teams in real time, keeping everyone informed."

### 4.2. **Can you explain how to set up automation rules in Jira?**
Automation rules consist of triggers (events), conditions (criteria), and actions (tasks). They streamline repetitive processes like assigning issues or sending notifications.

---

### 5.1. **How is Jira used in Agile frameworks like Scrum or Kanban?**
"In Scrum, Jira provides tools like Scrum boards for managing **sprint**s, **backlog**s, and tracking **task**s. For Kanban, it offers Kanban boards to visualize **workflow** and ensure a steady flow of work items. Both approaches make Jira indispensable for Agile teams."

### 5.2. **What is a Scrum board, and how do you use it in Jira?**
A Scrum board visualizes sprint progress, organizes tasks, and tracks completion. Itâ€™s ideal for iterative development.

---

### 6.1. **How do you manage permissions and roles in Jira?**
Permissions control user access, while roles define project-specific functions. Administrators assign roles and permissions to ensure secure collaboration.

### 6.2. **What is the difference between Jira Core, Jira Software, and Jira Service Desk?**
Jira Core is for business teams, Software caters to agile development, and Service Desk focuses on IT/helpdesk operations.

---

### 7.1. **Describe a situation where you used Jira to resolve a project management challenge.**
"At my previous job, our team faced difficulties tracking dependencies between tasks. I created linked issues in Jira and visualized dependencies on the Agile board. This improved task prioritization and minimized delays, enabling us to deliver the project on time."

### 7.2. **How do you prioritize tasks and manage dependencies in Jira?**
Use issue links to define dependencies (e.g., "blocks/blocked by") and prioritize tasks based on urgency and resource availability.

# Definitions

*Scrum*: Scrum is an iterative Agile framework for managing complex projects, emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement.

*Sprint*: Scrum organizes work into fixed-length cycles (typically 2-4 weeks), during which cross-functional teams deliver incremental, shippable product features.

*Key roles* include the
- *Product Owner*: holds authority over project, a representative of the client/customer
- *Scrum Master* (facilitates process)
- *Development Team* (self-organizing executors).

Scrum relies on *Scrum artifacts* like the
- *Project Backlog*: holds all the current requirements for the project
- *Sprint Backlog*: requirements that are to be completed in the current sprint
- *User Story*: an individual feature/requirement
- *Epic*: a group of related features that is broken down into multiple user stories
- *Sprint*: a brief period of development, (between 2 and 4 weeks). which generally cumulates in a release of realated features
- *Story Point*: In Scrum, a Story Point is a unit of measure used to estimate the effort required to complete a task or user story; reflects the complexity, risk, and amount of work involved, rather than the time it will take, assigned by team during planning sessions to prioritize tasks and forecast workload for upcoming sprints.
- *Velocity*: the sum of story points of all the user stories completed that week
- *Burndown Chart*: chart the amount of story points that been completed each day, vs the number of points remaining

and *Sprint Events* such as
- *Sprint Planning*: Holds before every sprint, to determine the scope, goals, and metrics of the sprint. Participants are the entire dev team, Scrum master, and product owner
- *Daily Stand-up*s: Meeting holds daily before work starts, lead by Scrum master where developers verbally reports their work progression, issues and the day's goal 
- *Review*: Holds at the end of a sprint, reviews what the team accomplished in that sprint
- Retrospectives: Scrum master reviews the metric, and assess any ineffiencies and plans to make improvemtents as a team
to foster transparency, inspection, and adaptation to changing requirements.

## Workflows

Workflows reflect how tasks move through different stages in a project. These workflows typically include:

1. **Statuses**: Represent the state of an issue, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
2. **Transitions**: Define how an issue moves between statuses, like "Start Progress" or "Complete Task."
3. **Post Functions**: Automate actions after a transition, such as assigning an issue or updating fields.
4. **Validators**: Set rules that must be met before a transition can occur, ensuring quality control.
5. **Workflow Properties**: Configure additional rules, like restricting who can transition issues.

Custom workflows are often created to match a team's unique processes, whether it's a simple setup or a complex workflow with multiple approvals and handoffs. They can be used in both team-managed and company-managed projects.

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices for using Jira effectively in a team:

1. **Define Clear Workflows**: Customize workflows to match your team's processes, ensuring clarity and consistency in task progression.

2. **Use Labels and Filters**: Organize issues with labels and create filters to quickly access relevant tasks.

3. **Prioritize Tasks**: Use backlog prioritization and issue ranking to focus on high-impact work.

4. **Leverage Dashboards**: Create shared dashboards with gadgets to monitor progress and key metrics.

5. **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Set up automation rules to streamline processes like notifications and issue assignments.

6. **Integrate Tools**: Connect Jira with other tools like Confluence or Slack for seamless collaboration.

7. **Regular Updates**: Encourage team members to update issue statuses and add comments to maintain transparency.

8. **Training and Onboarding**: Provide training for new team members to ensure they understand Jira's features and workflows.

9. **Monitor Work-in-Progress (WIP)**: Limit WIP items to avoid bottlenecks and maintain efficiency.

10. **Review and Improve**: Periodically review workflows and dashboards to adapt to evolving team needs.
